## Teachers / Professors Most Mind Our Own Business
#6 SPREADING SHIT ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK
> Complaining about you to other relatives, talking shit about you to your own friends, or spreading filth about you, and sometimes in quite a subtle or even humorous way, so you can’t really call it out, but the whole time they’re just lowering other people’s perceptions of you, so you’re left with nobody else to support you.

This is a very common manipulation technique that keeps you trapped with the parents and under their control because no-one else seems to be available to you.


## 2 UNFAIR COMPARISONS
Comparing you to someone in a specific area where the other person’s always better than you.

Like if you got second place in the race, “Why didn’t you get first?” even though you ran your best time ever.

“Your brother’s earning so much more than you,” even though he’s three years older and had more time to do it.

“Your sister is so much better than you because she’s got a boyfriend now,” even though her boyfriend is a dick.

This constant comparison to whatever you lack, and no matter what you do your parent finds somebody else to compare you to, somebody who’s doing better. This creates a sense that you’ll never be good enough.

# Rationale MOTIVES

## 1 FAMILY LEGACY
Quite often, what you’re getting is simply a representation of the parenting they received. They’re passing on the illness to you. If you’ve got a mother who guilt-trips you, it’s almost guaranteed that her mother guilt-tripped her too.

You’re getting this thing passed down through the generations, and I’d like to put in a little note here: it’s your chance to break the cycle. If you can deal with this, then you maybe won’t pass it on to your son or daughter.

My grandmother was very brutal and controlling with my mother. My mother, in turn, was merely a little paranoid and strict with me. Your parents are probably a less harmful version of their parents. You can carry on the work of reducing the harm.

## 2 NEED FOR CONTROL
Simply put: low self-esteem children are easier to manage.

If you need your parents’ approval to feel good about yourself then you’re very easy to control. From your parents’ point of view, it might not be a conscious plan on their part but it’s very simple for them to realize: “Hey, every time I put this kid down they do what I tell them to do. It’s a very easy process for me.”

So sometimes – as terrible as it sounds – your parents might be being mean to you just to make you less of an inconvenience, less of a hassle. That’s how bad it can be. Some people just aren’t meant to be parents, but they are anyway.

Consider this: if they really are just making you feel bad so that life is slightly easier for them, it shows that there is nothing wrong with you – they’re the bad guys in this movie. You’re the hero struggling to survive.

## 3 FEAR FOR REPUTATION
Quite often, your parents are simply afraid. Maybe they see your “failures” (by their own judgmental standards) are somehow a reflection of their own inadequacies as parents. Everything that they don’t like about you they don’t like about themselves, and so there’s this fear that you represent them.

Maybe it’s even quite literal, like they don’t want their church to see how “bad” you are as a kid or else their snooty friends will think they raised a bad Christian. They might be afraid that your behaviour will somehow reflect on them negatively, and they try to control you to avoid that judgment on them, especially if they’re very judgmental and they’ve received a lot of judgment in their life.

If they come from a very harshly judgmental community or family background themselves (e.g. conservative and religious), their reputation will be a big deal to them and you’ll be directly responsible (in their eyes) for that reputation.

# And when they don’t change, you must walk away.
